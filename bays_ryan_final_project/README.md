# Fall2023_final_project

I used to have a fascination about 1980s video games like pac man and space invaders. I wanted to make my project nostalgic for some people and I wanted to base it off soemthing that I found interesting. I'm in the processes of creating space invaders.

## Description

When I was younger and I first learned the basics of a computer, I used to play many different games on my mom's computer. I played games like roblox, pacman, and of course space invaders. I found space invaders to be one of the more basic, but more fun video games. I used to play it all the time until my life started getting busier. Due to this circumstance I wanted to create my own version of space invaders. I hope to make it look more realistic and function better using the graphic qualities of python.
